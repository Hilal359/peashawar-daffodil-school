<h5>Q.1) How many elements are present in each of the following?</h5>
<p>a) HF and Hf<br>                    
b)Co and CO<br>
c) Si and SiO2<br>                          
d) PoCl2 and POCl3<br>
Answer:<br>
a) HF and Hf<br>
HF: 2 elements H and F with atomic ratio 1:1<br>
Hf: 1 element<br>
b) Co and CO<br>
Co: 1 element<br>
CO: 2 elements C and O with atomic ratio 1:1<br>
c) Si and SiO2<br>
Si: 1 element<br>
SiO2: 2 elements with atomic ratio 1:2<br>
d) PoCl2 and POCl3<br>
PoCl2: 2 elements with atomic ratio 1:2<br>
POCl3: 3 elements with atomic ratio 1:1:3<br>

<h5>Q.2) Cm is the chemical symbol for curium, named after the famous scientist Madam Curie. Why wasn’t the symbol C, Cu or Cr used instead? </h5>
<p>Answer:
Curium was discovered in 1944, long after discovery of carbon (C), copper (Cu) and chromium (Cr), which were discovered in 3750 BC, 9000 BC and 1797 respectively. The symbols C, Cu and Cr were already used for elements carbon, Copper and chromium respectively. Using again these symbols would lead to confusion. Therefore, its chemical symbol could not be set as that of carbon, copper and chromium and taken as Cm.

<h5>Q.3) What is the atomic number of an element? How does it differ from the mass number?</h5>
<p>Answer:
Atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons present in the nucleus of its atoms. It is represented by symbol ‘Z’.
Atomic number = No. of protons
Mass number of an element is equal to the sum of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus of its atoms. It is represented by symbol ‘A’
Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons
A= Z+n
For example nitrogen atom has atomic number 7 and mass number 14, it can be written as 7N14.
